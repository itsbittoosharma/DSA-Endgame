21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
/*
Question Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/
Problem Description:



Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

 

Example 1:


Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

public class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        if(l1 == null){
            return l2;
        }
        if(l2 == null){
            return l1;
        }
        
        ListNode mergeHead;
        if(l1.val < l2.val){
            mergeHead = l1;
            mergeHead.next = mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2);
        }
        else{
            mergeHead = l2;
            mergeHead.next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next);
        }
        return mergeHead;
    }
}
